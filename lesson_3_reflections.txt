When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

         answer:to save it on cloud, to share it with other people and when you want to colaborate and work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  
         
         answer:may be after adding a change directly into github and if the change is not completely or logically correct.
